## Course Notes
All notes will be centralized within this directory.

## Final Project
The **Final Project** directory showcases a data engineering project designed to empower business intelligence insights. It includes:

- **ETL Pipelines**: Well-structured Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) processes that integrate diverse data sources into a cohesive data warehouse.
- **Data Models**: Comprehensive data models optimized for analytical queries, facilitating efficient data retrieval and reporting.
- **Documentation**: Detailed guides on pipeline architecture, data flow, and usage instructions for stakeholders.
- **Dashboards**: Interactive dashboards built using BI tools, demonstrating key metrics and visualizations derived from the processed data.
- **Testing Suite**: Automated tests to validate data integrity and pipeline performance, ensuring reliable analytics.

This directory serves as a practical demonstration of data engineering principles applied to generate actionable business insights, aligning with the goals of a business intelligence analyst.
